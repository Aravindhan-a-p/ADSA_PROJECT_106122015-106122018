# Enhancing String Matching Efficiency ---- A Study on BNDM (Backward Non-Deterministic DAWG Matching) Algorithm
## Overview

This project explores the efficiency of string matching algorithms, focusing on the BNDM (Backward Non-Deterministic DAWG Matching) algorithm. Our study compares the performance of the BNDM algorithm with two other well-known algorithms: Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) and Boyer-Moore-Horspool-Sunday (BMHS) and their combined version(I_KMP_BMHS2).

## Methodology
We conducted a comprehensive analysis of the BNDM, KMP, BMHS, and I_KMP_BMHS2 algorithms, focusing on four key performance metrics:
> **Runtime**: Measure of the time taken by each algorithm to find matches in a given text.

> **Memory Usage**: Evaluation of the memory footprint of each algorithm during execution.

>**Number of Comparisons**: Count of the total number of character comparisons performed by each algorithm.

>**Number of Shifts**: Total number of shifts made by the pattern during the matching process.
